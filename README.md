1. **Install Git**
First, you need to install Git on your local machine if you haven't already. You can download it from the Git website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

**For Linux users**
```bash
sudo apt install git 
```

**For Windows users**
- Refer to the Microsoft store or visit the https://git-scm.com/download/win

2. **Install Python and Django**
Make sure you have Python and Django installed on your system. You can download Python from the Python website, and you can install Django using pip:

``` bash
pip install django
```

3. **Clone the Repository**
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Use the git clone command followed by the URL of the GitHub repository.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/BhavaniShankar2004/LikeStream.git
```

4. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
Change into the newly created directory that contains the cloned project:

```bash
cd LikeStream
```

5. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
It is a good practice to use a virtual environment for your Django project to manage dependencies. You can create a virtual environment using the following command:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```


6. **Activate the virtual environment**
On Windows:
``` powershell
venv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS and Linux:
``` bash
source venv/bin/activate
```


7. **Install Dependencies**
Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. Run the following command:

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

8. Configure the Database
Depending on the database used by the project, you might need to set up and configure your database. This usually involves:
- Creating a new database.
- Updating the DATABASES setting in the settings.py file with your database credentials.

9. **Run Migrations**
Apply the database migrations to set up the database schema. Run the following command:

``` bash
python manage.py migrate
```

10. **Create a Superuser**
Create a superuser account to access the Django admin interface:

``` bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

11. **Run the Development Server**
Start the Django development server to verify that everything is working correctly:

``` bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to see your Django project in action.


Additional Steps (if applicable)
Set Up Environment Variables: If the project uses environment variables (e.g., for secret keys, API keys, etc.), create a .env file in the project root and add the necessary variables.
Static and Media Files: Ensure that static and media files are correctly set up. This might involve running python manage.py collectstatic and configuring AWS S3 or another service for media file storage.
That's it! You should now have a cloned and running Django project from GitHub. If you encounter any issues, refer to the project's README file for additional instructions specific to the project.
